	<p> I am not much of a blogger unfortunately. Perhaps in the future I will blog about topics in programming that I am exploring </p>
	<br />
	<p> I am a fan of basketball. I follow the Detroit Pistons as they are the basketball team of my hometown, and I watch the major games of the Michigan Wolverines, such as the Big ten tournament. I watch the NCAA March madness tournament as well as the the NBA playoffs pretty heavily. I played basketball up until the end of my freshmen year in high school, when I was no longer good enough to make the school's JV team, and did not have the ability to commit to the time

	<p> My favorite food is Pizza. I prefer deep dish pizza with pepperoni. My favorite brand is Jets, but I also like Buddy's Pizza.

	<p> My hometown is Novi, MI. <cite> It was established in 1969 </cite>. It was named after a train station, which was called No. VI, which then became Novi. It is located in Oakland County, MI, a suburb of Detroit MI. It's public school system was rated as the 2nd best in, Oakland county, after that of Troy, MI.
